<p id="paragraph">
Front-end development has always been a dynamic and ever-evolving field.<br>
 As we push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web,
  we’ve seen a shift from static pages to interactive experiences that feel more like applications than websites.<br>
With the rise of frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular,<br>
 front-end developers now have powerful tools at their disposal to create complex,<br> 
 responsive user interfaces. <br>
 These frameworks have introduced new concepts like component-based architecture and virtual DOM,<br> 
 which have significantly improved the efficiency and maintainability of code.<br>
